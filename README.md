# Addicted2Captcha
This plugin was created to prevent possible bot spam on minecraft servers. The first time players enter the server, they will be put to a captcha test by writing a chat code to unlock it.

Commands:

/ addicted2 reset - lock the chat for a specific player, resolving the captcha again

/ addicted2 verify - saves a specific player from solving the captcha
